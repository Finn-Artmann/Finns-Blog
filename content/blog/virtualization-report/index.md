## Abstract

Virtualization solutions within embedded systems play a crucial role, offering benefits in varied industries including automotive,
aerospace and IoT. The contribution of this work is an overview of the current state-of-the-art, identifying open questions and
outlining new developments. The methodology involves a systematic review of recent literature, which is categorized based on
content and keywords. Central findings from existing studies are summarized according to different virtualization approaches
and enhanced with new insights from the reviewed papers, allowing for future exploration of presented research directions.
